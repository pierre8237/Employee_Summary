## Description

This project is an employee template engine for a small business to maintain a roster of current employees and their respective roles and departments with unfettered and visually pleasing cards. It is a CLI app that can create cards based on user imput to inquirer prompts. Each profile of the possible employee types is saved as a class, and the classes are exported where they can be used to create a new instance of an employee. Then this template is then rendered as a card, and the card is rendered to a page where it is displayed and arrained using bootstrap classes. The required packages are fs, path, and inquirer.
